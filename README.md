# Code Repository

## Purpose

This repository is a hands-on collection of different low-level design concepts implemented in Java. The goal is to explore and demonstrate various design techniques and patterns using core Java, without any external dependencies.

## Getting Started

- **Language:** Java (100% core Java)
- **Dependencies:** None (no external libraries required)

## How to Run

Each package contains its own `Main` class to demonstrate and run the concepts in that module. To execute a specific design concept:

1. Open the package you are interested in.
2. Locate the `Main` class within that package.
3. Run the `Main` class using your preferred Java IDE or the command line.

Example (using command line):

```sh
javac path/to/package/Main.java
java package.Main
